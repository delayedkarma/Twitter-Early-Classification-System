# Twitter-Early-Classification-System

In this project, I have attempted to create an end-to-end Twitter early classification system (to predict, given a tweet, whether Justin Bieber is in trouble or not). I have created the training and test sets (which are quite small) and implemented some basic ML classification techniques. 

There is plenty of room for improvement, and I will keep adding to it as and when I get the time.
